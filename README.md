Currency Detail Page

How to use this repo

1. git clone "Cryptocurrency-React-App" to get local copy of the project
2. Use npm install  
3. Run npm start 


Instructions:

1. For cryptocurrency icons, I use "https://cryptofont.com/". This library facilitate to add Cryptocurrency icons dynamically.

2. Axios request used for backend api calls.
3. First I use two different API calls for listing and detail page, then I realize that both API's has same data we required, therefore I use REDUX to pass state to Detail page.

4. Custom css is used for creating these two pages. But my main focus was React and Redux part.
